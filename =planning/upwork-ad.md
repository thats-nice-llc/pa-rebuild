# Overview
We run a digital trade magazine for the pharmaceutical industry. Our clients can pay to have custom articles featured or an ad placed on our site. We need a modern CMS solution that can help us track impressions by company.

## Deliverable
We need a PHP/Laravel developer who can build the back end and scaffold out a basic front end of a refresh of our current website. We would like to achieve the following goals:

- A CMS that is customized for our article/ad structure.
- Articles that can easily be edited and managed by copy writers and non-technical people.
- Impression tracking needed for all articles, ads and pages.
- Article and page search
- Well-defined user roles such as Author, Client, Admin, etc...
- A dashboard for our editors to control banner ads on the website.
- A client-facing dashboard where the client can view impressions related only to their company.

Nice to haves, but not deal breakers:

- We want a CMS that is very simple for our writers to use. Drag and drop editing for customization of pages would be ideal, which is why are leaning toward Twill and Statamic. We don't need it to be like a Word document, but we want content editing that can make custom articles easily achievable. This isn't a requirement, but if you have strong ideas on how this could be implemented, it would put you at the top of our list.
- We would like to implement Laravel Livewire in this project as well for things like search functionality. If that's something you can implement during the build out, it would be a huge head start for our busy team.

As mentioned, we are leaning toward Twill or Statamic for the CMS and Matomo (formerly Piwik) for analytics, but are open to any suggestions. We don't know much about CraftCMS, but we are open to it if you think it may suit our needs and have a strong argument for it. We just want something that we can easily customize in the future. If we need to add a new element to the editor like a custom slider or front end element, we want it to be easy for us to do and easy for our content editors to be trained on how to use. We are a small team of developers, but we know Laravel/PHP and want a platform that enables us to quickly add customization on the back end in the future.

We aren't sure yet if we are doing a full design refresh, so you will not have to build the vast majority of front end of this website, but we will want organized templates with detailed instructions how to push everything to the front end as needed for the design.
